A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)

		We went to school together and reconnected after we graduated and we have been together ever since. We were

						Kroger was very good to me in the 15 total years that I worked for them and I spent most of my tenure there
				working on one of these two machines. I changed batteries in forklifts and pallet jacks and it really taught me
				teamwork and the value of hard work as well. It was a great job that prepared me to follow this dream of
				learning software development.
